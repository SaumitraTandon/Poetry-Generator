## Introduction

The Poetry Generator is a Python-based project that generates poetry using a Markov Chain model. By analyzing word transitions in a given text, the model predicts the next word based on the preceding words, resulting in unique and often surprising poetic compositions. This project is ideal for experimenting with text generation and exploring the beauty of algorithmic creativity.

## Features

- **Markov Chain-based Text Generation**: The generator uses both first and second-order Markov Chains, allowing it to generate contextually relevant sequences of words based on probabilities derived from input text.
- **Customizable Output**: Easily adjust the number of lines generated to fit your needs, whether it's a short haiku or a lengthy verse.
- **Modular and Extensible**: The code is designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy to modify, extend, or integrate into other projects.

## Installation

Before running the Poetry Generator, ensure that Python is installed on your system. You'll also need the `numpy` library, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Jupyter Notebook

This project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, so you'll need to install Jupyter if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Once installed, you can run the notebook using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Text Data

The Markov Chain model requires a dataset to learn from. You can use any text file containing poetry, prose, or any other form of literature. The more text you provide, the richer the generated poetry will be.

### 2. Run the Notebook

Open the `Poetry_Generator.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells in order. The core function, `generate()`, is responsible for generating poetry.

### 3. Customize Output

By default, the generator produces four lines of poetry. You can customize the output by modifying the loop in the `generate()` function:

```python
for i in range(4):  # Adjust the number of lines here
```

Feel free to experiment with different input texts and output lengths to see how the poetry evolves!

## Examples

Here is a sample output generated by the model:

```
two winds would meet
two miles it was long i lay
two miles it was grassy and wanted wear
two miles it was
```

As you can see, the generator produces lines that are both coherent and poetic, with a touch of randomness that adds to their charm.

## Exercises

The notebook also includes exercises that help you explore and understand the underlying Markov Chain model:

- **Exercise 1: Vocabulary Size**  
  Explore the vocabulary size and compare the number of values stored in the transition matrices and dictionaries.

- **Exercise 2: Optimizing Word Sampling**  
  Learn how to optimize the word sampling process by directly creating a dictionary of counts instead of accumulating word lists.

These exercises provide an excellent opportunity to deepen your understanding of Markov Chains and improve the generator's efficiency.
